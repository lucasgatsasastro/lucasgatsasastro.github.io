<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024" target="_blank">On April 8, 2024 a Total Solar Eclipse</a></strong> captivated millions of people across North America. This rare celestial event, during which the Moon completely covered the Sun and turned day into night, was visible along a narrow path stretching across the continent—from Mexico through the United States to Canada.


"My first segment of the solar eclipse that took place on <strong>April 8, 2024, in Dallas, Texas.</strong> For this event, I set up two cameras at different locations to capture the phenomenon from various perspectives. Additionally, I positioned one camera in New York, which was only able to capture a partial view of the eclipse."

After much effort, I finally managed to process everything and complete all the tasks.

The weather in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas" target="_blank">Dallas, Texas</a></strong> was poor with too many clouds. I could only photograph the total maximum eclipse and Contact C3. The clouds blocked everything else. See Video

<h3><strong>Key Details About the Solar Eclipse:</strong></h3>
<strong>Date:</strong> Monday, April 8, 2024<br>
<strong>Duration of Totality:</strong> Depending on the location, it lasted up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds—making it one of the longest solar eclipses of this century.<br>
<strong>Path of Totality:</strong> It began over the Pacific Ocean, crossed central Mexico, moved through the U.S. (from Texas to Maine), and ended in Canada (Newfoundland).<br>
<strong>Most Stunning Phase:</strong>  During totality, the Sun’s corona—the outer atmosphere—became visible, a phenomenon that can only be observed during total solar eclipses.

<h3>What Happened?</h3>


<strong>Gradual Darkening:</strong>  Hours before and after totality, the Moon slowly moved across the Sun.<br>
<strong>Sudden Darkness:</strong>  Within seconds, it turned as dark as night, temperatures dropped, and animals exhibited unusual behavior.<br>
<strong>Corona Viewing:</strong>  The corona shone as a delicate, silvery ring—an awe-inspiring sight for both scientists and amateur astronomers.<br>



My Collection of Gear for Experiencing the Total Solar Eclipse:

<strong> Camera : Canon EOS 6D Markii<br>
Lens : EF 75 – 300mm f/5.6<br>
Settings : 1/4000s – 1.4s – f/5.6 – ISO 100<br>
Mount : Rollei C5i + SkyWatcher – Solarquest<br>
Solar Filter : Baader ND 0.3</strong>

Here’s a photo of my gear, including my camera. I designed this setup specifically to meet the hand luggage restrictions for airlines like <strong>Swiss and American Airlines:</strong>  a maximum of <strong>8 kg</strong>  and dimensions of <strong>55 x 40 x 23 cm.</strong> 

<strong>The planning process was extremely meticulous and time-consuming.</strong>  Preparing for a solar eclipse often takes six months to a year. Many factors influence the quality of the photos, especially <strong>the weather & Locations.</strong> That’s why it’s crucial to <strong> have a backup location</strong> in place to stay flexible in case of unfavorable conditions.

"When choosing a location, I considered two options. Since New York was outside the path of totality, I settled on Dallas, Texas. Its warm, sunny weather and proximity to Mexico made it an ideal choice, especially compared to the colder, cloudier conditions in the north. For us astrophotographers, clear, cloudless skies are essential."

<h3>How Many People Witnessed the Eclipse?</h3>

Experts estimated that over <strong>50 million people</strong> along the path of totality experienced the eclipse directly. Additionally, hundreds of millions more witnessed a partial eclipse, as large parts of North America were within the partial eclipse zone.


<h3>Why Was This Event So Special?</h3>

This was the last total solar eclipse to cross the U.S. for the next 20 years. A comparable event will not occur again until August 2044.

<h3>How Did People Prepare for It?</h3>

<strong>Protective Glasses:</strong>  Many used certified solar eclipse glasses to protect their eyes when the Sun was not fully covered.
<strong>Choosing the Right Location:</strong>  Thousands traveled to the path of totality to experience the full spectacle.<br>

> All is well, provided the light returns and the eclipse does not become an endless night. Dawn and resurrection are synonyms. The reappearance of the light is the same as the survival of the soul.

The <strong>Total Solar Eclipse on April 8, 2024</strong>  was not just an astronomical event but an unforgettable moment that connected people worldwide and reminded us of the wonders of our universe.
