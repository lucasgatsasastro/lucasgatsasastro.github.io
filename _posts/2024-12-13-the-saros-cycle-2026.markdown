<strong>The total eclipse 2026</strong> will pass over the Arctic, Greenland, Iceland, Atlantic Ocean, northern Spain and very extreme northeastern Portugal. A partial eclipse will cover more than 90% of the Sun in Ireland, Great Britain, Portugal, France, Italy, the Balkans and North Africa and to a lesser extent in most of Europe, West Africa and northern North America.

<h3>Once in Lifetime Experience</h3>
<strong>The total eclipse</strong>  will be visible from the cities of A <strong> Coruña, Valencia, Zaragoza, Palma and Bilbao</strong>, but both Madrid and Barcelona will be just outside the path of totality.

During a total solar eclipse, the <strong> "path of totality"</strong>  is a narrow strip where the Moon completely covers the Sun, casting a shadow on the Earth and allowing viewers to experience total darkness during the eclipse. Cities like A Coruña, Valencia, Zaragoza, Palma, and Bilbao are in this path and will witness totality, while Madrid and Barcelona, being slightly outside this path, will experience a partial eclipse instead.

If you're planning to view the eclipse, it's always best to be within the path of totality for the full experience. Proper eclipse glasses or solar filters are essential for safe viewing!

<strong> That's fantastic!</strong>  Photographing a total solar eclipse can be a truly rewarding experience. Since you're interested in solar imaging and astrophotography, here are some tips for capturing this extraordinary event:

<h3>Equipment Preparation</h3>

1. <strong>Camera:</strong>  A DSLR or mirrorless camera with manual settings is ideal.
2. <strong>Lens:</strong>  A telephoto lens or telescope with a focal length of 300mm or more is great for capturing the Sun in detail.
3. <strong>Solar Filter:</strong>  Ensure you have a certified solar filter for your lens or telescope to protect your gear and your eyes during partial phases.
4. <strong>Tripod:</strong>  A sturdy tripod is essential for stable shots.
5. <strong>Remote Shutter Release:</strong>  Reduces vibrations and allows precise timing.

<h3>Eclipse Phases to Capture</h3>

1. <strong>Partial Eclipse:</strong>  Use the solar filter to capture the Sun with the "bite" taken out of it.
2. <strong>Baily’s Beads & Diamond Ring:</strong>  Just before and after totality, the last bits of sunlight shine through lunar valleys. Remove the filter during totality to capture these moments.
3. <strong>Totality:</strong>  During this brief phase, remove the filter and photograph the corona, solar flares, and possibly stars.


<h3>Camera Settings</h3>

* <strong>ISO:</strong>  Start with ISO 100-400 depending on lighting conditions.
* <strong>Aperture:</strong>  Use an aperture of f/8-f/16 for sharpness.
* <strong>Shutter Speed:</strong>  Vary this from 1/1000s to a few seconds depending on the phase and desired effect.
* <strong>Bracket Shots:</strong>  Take multiple exposures to capture details of the corona and surrounding features.

<h3>Practical Tips</h3>

<strong>Scout Locations Early:</strong> Choose a spot in the path of totality with a clear view of the horizon.
<strong>Practice Beforehand:</strong> Familiarize yourself with your gear by practicing on the Sun or Moon.
<strong>Time It Right:</strong> Use apps like Solar Eclipse Timer to keep track of phases.
<strong>Bring Extras:</strong> Extra batteries, memory cards, and protective equipment are a must.

<h3>Recommendations for Eclipse Photography</h3>

<h4>Locations in the Path of Totality</h4>
Since the eclipse will pass over cities like A Coruña, Valencia, Zaragoza, Palma, and Bilbao, consider these factors when choosing your spot:

* <strong>Weather Forecast:</strong> Clear skies are crucial. Check historical weather patterns for minimal cloud cover.
* <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Ensure your location is easy to access with your gear.
* <strong>Horizon View:</strong> Choose a site with an unobstructed view of the Sun's path, like a beach, hilltop, or open field.

<strong>Specific Recommendations:</strong>

1. <strong>A Coruña:</strong> Coastal spots like Torre de Hércules offer great vistas.
2. <strong>Valencia:</strong> Beaches or nearby parks such as Albufera National Park.
3. <strong>Zaragoza:</strong> Open fields near the outskirts for less light pollution.
4. <strong>Palma (Mallorca):</strong> Beaches or elevated spots in the Serra de Tramuntana mountains.
5. <strong>Bilbao:</strong> Nearby hills like Mount Artxanda for panoramic views.

<h3><strong>Gear Recommendations</strong></h3>

1. <h3>Solar Filter:</h3>

* <strong>Thousand Oaks Optical Solar Filter or Baader AstroSolar Film</strong> for safe imaging during partial phases.
Ensure it's securely mounted to avoid accidental exposure.

2. <h3>Camera:</h3>

* <strong>Canon EOS R6/R5, Nikon Z6 II, or Sony A7 IV:</strong> Excellent low-light capabilities for corona details.
For beginners, the Canon EOS Rebel T8i or Nikon D5600 are solid choices.

3. <h3>Lenses/Telescopes:</h3>

* <strong>Telephoto Lenses:</strong> Canon EF 100-400mm, Sony FE 200-600mm, or equivalent.
* <strong>Telescope Options:</strong> Celestron NexStar 6SE or Sky-Watcher Evostar ED refractor for detailed close-ups.


4. <h3>Tripod and Accessories:</h3>

* <strong>SkyWatcher SolarQuest:</strong> Compact and sturdy.
* <strong>Intervalometer:</strong> For automated time-lapse or multiple exposures.


<h3><strong>Settings for the Eclipse Phases</strong></h3>

1. <h3>Partial Phase (with Solar Filter):</h3>

* <strong>Shutter Speed: 1/500s to 1/2000s.</strong>
* <strong>ISO: 100-200.</strong>
* <strong>Aperture: f/8-f/16.</strong>

2. <h3>Totality (No Solar Filter):</h3>

* <strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Range from 1/1000s to 2 seconds for corona and star field.
* <strong>ISO: 400-800.</strong>
* <strong>Aperture: f/4-f/11 (depending on lens quality).</strong>


3. <h3>HDR (Bracketing):</h3>

* <strong>Capture multiple exposures (e.g., ±2 EV) for later blending.</strong>


<h3><strong>Additional Apps and Tools</strong></h3>

* <strong>PhotoPills:</strong>  Plan compositions and Sun tracking.
* <strong>SkySafari:</strong>  For detailed Sun/Moon positioning.
* <strong>Solar Eclipse Timer:</strong>  Helps with phase timing and safety reminders.


> Astronomers are greatly disappointed when, having traveled halfway around the world to see an eclipse, clouds prevent a sight of it; and yet a sense of relief accompanies the disappointment.
